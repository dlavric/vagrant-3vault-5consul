1. Install the Consul client on the Vault server via apt-repository

2. In order to connect Vault to the Consul client we need to use the local host address: 127.0.0.1

3. Configure Consul client which is located on the Vault server to talk to the Consul server

4. Make the configuration of Consul work and form a cluster. Do this by understanding the paramters of the configuration of Consul

The Consul machine should retry the join to the others machine's IPs

Example:

Consul 1 - IP 1
Consul 2 - IP 2
Consul 3 - IP 3

Consul 1 should retry with IP 2 & IP 3 and so on

NOT WORKING FOR MY env:
cat << EOF > /etc/consul.d/server_node_2_config.json
{
 "bind_addr": "172.20.30.12", => the consul's machine address
 "datacenter": "dc-west",
 "data_dir": "/opt/consul",
 "log_level": "INFO",
 "enable_syslog": true,
 "enable_debug": true,
 "node_name": "dc-west-consul-server-two",
 "server": true, => it is not an agent server
 "client_addr": "0.0.0.0", 
 "bootstrap_expect": 3, => 2 consul servers trying to rejoin, it's not going to work. 3 Nodes are needed at least to be up for it to work
 "rejoin_after_leave": true,
 "ui": true,
 "retry_join": [
    "172.20.30.11","172.20.30.13"
    ]
}
EOF

5. Think on how can I provision different configuration files to different consul machines

If Vault and Consul are in different networks, a router needs to be used for them to communicate one with each others
In my case, I should use the same network for Vault and Consul to make them communicate to each other


Figure out what is the purpose of the network mask in my environment

Consul
192.168.56.141 

192.168.56.0 - Network address
0.0.0.141 - Host address

Vault
192.168.56.151 /24

192.168.56.0 - Network address
0.0.0.151 - Host address


The subnet mask is used by the router to cover up the network address

The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting.

TO DO: Review the Networking+ book the chapter to determine the network address and do some exercises 
on paper

Ipv4 - has 32 bits

The IP address is divided to 4 ... it has 4 parts and I need to figure out what are those parts??

1. What is the default gateway?
Node that allows 2 or more machines to communicate to each other when in different networks
Is the default route taken if there is no other specification of doing differently.

Default gateways are essentially routing systems that ensure the request is sent 
to the right destination, even if the sender and receiver use different network protocols.

2. What is broadcast?
Broadcasting is a method of transferring a message to all recipients simultaneously

3. Learn about the OSI model

OSI 7 layers
Open Systems Interconnection

There are 7 layers that computer use to communicate in the network.

7 - Human interaction - application level where they can access the network
6 - Presentation - data is in a usable format and is where data encryption occurs 
5 - Session - maintains connections and is responsible for controlling parts and sessions
4 - Transport - transmits data using transmission protocols TCP / UDP
3 - Network - Decides which physical path the data will take
2 - Data link - Defines the format of data on the network
1 - Physical - Transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium

4. Learn about TCP/IP model

Application Layer 7 - Human interaction - application level where they can access the network
Application Layer 6 - Presentation - data is in a usable format and is where data encryption occurs 
Application Layer 5 - Session - maintains connections and is responsible for controlling parts and sessions

Transport Layer 4 - Transport - transmits data using transmission protocols TCP / UDP

Internet Layer 3 - Network - Decides which physical path the data will take

Network access Layer 2 - Data link - Defines the format of data on the network
Network access Layer 1 - Physical - Transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium

5. Compare two models 

TCP/IP is older than the OSI model 
TCP/IP is simple than OSI model - collapsing some levels from OSI model

6. How many bits are in one byte?

1 byte = 8 bit

6. Layer 2 / Layer 3 I should understand what each layer does and compare them

7. What retry join of Consul does?

Allows retrying a join until it is successful. 
Once it joins successfully to a member in a list of members it will never attempt to join again
The client will make the request to any servers listed in the -join or -retry-join option

8. What do I need to do to save the file in `vi`? top priority and check if it saved
Hit ESC
write :w! - save the file 
write :q! - quit without saving

Save and Quit: :wq!

9. If a service is listening on localhost, from where it can be accessed?

10. What should be the address for the TCP to listen to in the vault config listener "tcp" ?
Aug 03 13:09:57 vault-1 vault[2647]: Error parsing cluster address 127.0.0.1:8201: parse "127.0.0.1:8201": invalid URI for request

The value can be set as 0.0.0.0:8200 to listen for requests on all interfaces. 
Using 0.0.0.0:8200 it may not be the good choice from a security standpoint

cluster_addr=http://127.0.0.1:8201

11. How many listeners Vault has?
Vault is using 8200 and 8201 

8200 - is used for client communciation (front door of a store)
8201 - cluster and node to node communication (the backdoor from a store where i receive goods or deliver goods to otehr stores)

12. Find what is the difference between the address and api_addr, cluster_address and cluster_addr in the Vault config.

13. What is TLS and what is a TLS certificate?

14. Find the command that generates TLS certificates and understand it.

15. What is a CA ? What is intermediate Certificate (CA)

16. How do we sign a certificate? What is a CSR?

Generate a certificate and put the correct DNS and IP SANs 

17. What is a .gitignore file and how do I use it?
